# Metadata for internal use

The metadata.md file includes repo-level metadata that passes through to user guide TOC.md files in the repo. If you want to change metadata.md content for any user guide, do so in any TOC.md file.

See [Metadata](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/authoring-guide-exl/using/editing/user-guide-setup/metadata.html) for a list of valid values for **solution**, **product**, and **type**.
